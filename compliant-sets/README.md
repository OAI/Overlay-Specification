# OpenAPI Overlay Compliant Sets

The folders in this directory contain sets of "known good" Overlays, along with OpenAPI descriptions before and after the Overlay.
These files are offered as examples of how a series of Overlays are expected to be applied, with the aim of supporting people building tools that apply Overlays.

Each directory contains:
- `overlay.yaml` - the Overlay
- `openapi.yaml` - an OpenAPI description to use
- `output.yaml` - the OpenAPI description after the Overlay has been applied
